<h2><a name="platform-symbols">Platform Symbol Files (.sym65)</a></h2>

<p>Platform symbol files contain lists of symbols, each of which has a
label and a value.  SourceGen comes with a collection of symbols for
popular systems, but you can create your own.  This can be handy if a
few different projects are coded against a common library.</p>

<p>If two symbols have the same value, the older symbol is replaced by
the newer one.  This is why the order in which symbol files are loaded
matters.</p>

<p>Platform symbol files consist of comments, commands, and symbols.
Blank lines, and lines that begin with a semicolon (';'), are ignored.  Lines
that begin with an asterisk ('*') are commands.  Two are currently
defined:</p>
<ul>
  <li>*SYNOPSIS - a short summary of the file contents.</li>
  <li>*TAG - a tag string to apply to all symbols that follow in this
    file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tags can be used by extension scripts to identify a subset of symbols.
The symbols are still part of the global set; the tag just provides a
way to extract a subset.  Tags should be comprised of non-whitespace ASCII
characters.  Tags are global, so use a long, descriptive string.  If *TAG
is not followed by a string, the symbols that follow are treated as
untagged.</p>

<p>All other lines are symbols, which have the form:</p>
<pre>
  label {=|@} value [;comment]
</pre>

<p>Labels must be at least two characters long, begin with a letter or
underscore, and consist entirely of alphanumeric ASCII characters
(A-Z, a-z, 0-9) and the underscore ('_').  (This is the same format
required for line labels in SourceGen.)</p>
<p>Use '@' for address values, and '=' for constants.  The only important
difference between them is that address values will be applied automatically
to operands that reference addresses outside the scope of the file.
Constants are never applied automatically.</p>

<p>The value is a number in decimal, hexadecimal (with a leading '$'), or
binary (with a leading '%').  The numeric base will be recorded and used when
formatting the symbol in generated output, so use whichever form is most
appropriate.  Values are unsigned 24-bit numbers.</p>

<p>The comment is optional.  If present, it will be saved and used as the
end-of-line comment on the .EQ directive if the symbol is used.</p>

<h3>Creating a Project-Specific Symbol File</h3>

<p>To create a platform symbol file for your project, just create a new
text file, named with a ".sym65" extension.  (If your text editor of choice
doesn't like that, you can put a ".txt" on the end while you're editing.)
Make sure you create it in the same directory where your project file
(the file that ends with ".dis65") lives.  Add a *SYNOPSIS, then add
the desired symbols.</p>
<p>Finally, add it to your project.  Select Edit &gt; Project Properties,
switch to the Symbol Files tab, click Add Symbol Files, and select your
symbol file.  It should appear in the list with a "PROJ:" prefix.</p>

<p>If an example helps, the A2-Amper-fdraw project in the Examples
directory has a project-local symbol file, called "fdraw-exports".
(Amper-fdraw provides an Applesoft BASIC interface to a machine-language
library.)</p>

<p>NOTE: in the current version of SourceGen, changes to .sym65 files are
not detected automatically.  Closing and re-opening the project
(File &gt; Close, then click on the first recent-file link) will reload
them.</p>


<h2><a name="extension-scripts">Extension Scripts</a></h2>

<p>Extension scripts, also called "plugins", are C# programs with access to
the full .NET Standard 2.0 APIs.  They're compiled at run time by SourceGen
and executed in a sandbox with security restrictions.</p>

<p>SourceGen defines an interface that plugins must implement, and an
interface that plugins can use to interact with SourceGen.  See
Interfaces.cs in the PluginCommon directory.  <b>Bear in mind that this
feature is still evolving, and the interfaces may change significantly
in the near future.</b></p>

<p>The current interfaces can be used to identify inline data that follows
JSR, JSL, or BRK instructions, and to format operands.  The latter can be
useful for replacing immediate load operands with symbolic constants.</p>

<p>Scripts may be loaded from the RuntimeData directory, or from the directory
where the project file lives.  Attempts to load them from other locations
will fail.</p>

<h4>Development</h4>

<p>The easiest way to develop extension scripts is inside the 6502bench
solution in Visual Studio.  This way you have the interfaces available
for IntelliSense completion, and get all the usual syntax and compile
checking in the editor.  (This is why there's a RuntimeData project for
Visual Studio.)</p>

<p>If you have the solution configured for debug builds, SourceGen will set
the IncludeDebugInformation flag to true when compiling scripts.  This
causes a .PDB file to be created.</p>

<p>Some commonly useful functions are defined in the PluginCommon.Util class,
which is available to plugins.  These call into the CommonUtil library,
which is shared with SourceGen.</p>

<p>While plugins can use CommonUtil directly, they should avoid doing so.  The
APIs there are not guaranteed to be stable, so plugins that rely on them
may break in a subsequent release of SourceGen.</p>

<h4>PluginDll Directory</h4>

<p>Extension scripts are compiled into .DLLs, and saved in the PluginDll
directory, which lives next to the application executable and RuntimeData.
If the extension script is the same age or older than the DLL, SourceGen
will continue to use the existing DLL.</p>

<p>The DLLs names are a combination of the script filename and script location.
The compiled name for "MyPlatform/MyScript.cs" in the RuntimeData directory
will be "RT_MyPlatform_MyScript.dll".  For a project-specific script, it
would look like "PROJ_MyProject_MyScript.dll".</p>

<p>The PluginCommon and CommonUtil DLLs will be copied into the directory, so
that code in the sandbox has access to them.</p>

<h4>Sandboxing</h4>

<p>Extension scripts are executed in an App Domain sandbox.  App domains are
a .NET feature that creates a partition inside the virtual machine, isolating
code.  It still runs in the same address space, on the same threads, so the
isolation is only effective for "partially trusted" code that has been
declared safe by the bytecode verifier.</p>

<p>SourceGen disallows most actions, notably file access.  An exception is
made for reading files from the directory where the plugin DLLs live, but
scripts are otherwise unable to read or write from the filesystem.  (A
future version of SourceGen may provide an API that allows limited access
to data files.)</p>

<p>App domain security is not absolute.  I don't really expect SourceGen to
be used as a malware vector, so there's no value in forcing scripts to
execute in an isolated server process, or to jump through the other hoops
required to really lock things down.  I do believe there's value in
defining the API in such a way that we <b>could</b> implement full security if
circumstances change, so I'm using app domains as a way to keep the API
honest.</p>


<h2><a name="multi-bin">Working With Multiple Binaries</a></h2>

<p>Sometimes a program is split into multiple files on disk.  They
may be all loaded at once, or some may be loaded into the same place
at different times.  In such situations it's not uncommon for one
file to provide a set of interfaces that other files use.  It's
useful to have symbols for these interfaces be available to all
projects.</p>
<p>There are two ways to do this: (1) define a common platform symbol
file with the relevant addresses, and keep it up to date as you work;
or (2) declare the labels as global and exported, and import them
as project symbols into the other projects.</p>
<p>Support for this is currently somewhat weak, requiring a manual
symbol-import step in every interested project.  This step must be
repeated whenever the labels are updated.</p>
<p>A different but related problem is typified by arcade ROM sets,
where files are split apart because each file must be burned into a
separate PROM.  All files are expected to be present in memory at
once, so there's no reason to treat them as separate projects. Currently,
the best way to deal with this is to concatenate the files into a single
file, and operate on that.</p>

<h2><a name="overlap">Overlapping Address Spaces</a></h2>
<p>Some programs use memory overlays, where multiple parts of the
code run in the same address in RAM.  Others use bank switching to access
parts of the program that reside in separate physical RAM, but appear at
the same address.</p>
<p>SourceGen allows you to set the same address on multiple parts of
a file.  Branches to a given address are resolved against the current
segment first.  For example, consider this:</p>
<pre>
         .ORG    $1000
         JMP     L1100

         .ORG    $1100
L1100    BIT     L1100
L1103    LDA     #$11
         BRA     L1103

         .ORG    $1100
L1100_0  BIT     L1100_0
L1103_0  LDA     #$22
         JMP     L1103_0
</pre>

<p>Both sections start at $1100, and have branches to $1103.  The branch
in the first section resolves to the label in the first version of
that address chunk, while the branch in the second section resolves to
the label in the second chunk.  When branches originate outside the current
address chunk, the first chunk that includes that address is used, as
it is with the <code>JMP $1000</code> at the start of the file.</p>


<h2><a name="debug">Debug Menu Options</a></h2>

<p>The DEBUG menu is hidden by default in release builds, but can be
exposed by checking the "enable DEBUG menu" box in the application
settings.  These features are used for debugging SourceGen.  They will
not help you debug 6502 projects.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Re-analyze (F5).  Causes a full re-analysis.  Useful if you think
    the display is out of sync.</li>
  <li>Show Problem List Viewer.  Opens a floating window that shows some
    of the problems encountered during the last analysis pass.</li>
  <li>Show Undo/Redo History.  Opens a floating window that lets you
    watch the contents of the undo buffer while you work.</li>
  <li>Show Analyzer Output.  Opens a floating window with a text log from
    the most recent analysis pass.  The exact contents will vary depending
    on how the verbosity level is configured internally.  Debug messages
    from extension scripts appear here.</li>
  <li>Show Analysis Timers.  Opens a floating window with a dump of
    timer results from the most recent analysis pass.  Times for individual
    stages are noted, as are times for groups of functions.  This
    provides a crude sense of where time is being spent.</li>
  <li>Extension Script Info.  Shows a bit about the currently-loaded
    extension scripts.</li>
  <li>Toggle Comment Rulers.  Adds a string of digits above every
    multi-line comment (long comment, note).  Useful for confirming that
    the width limitation is being obeyed.  These are added exactly
    as shown, without comment delimiters, into generated assembly output,
    which doesn't work out well if you run the assembler.</li>
  <li>Use Keep-Alive Hack.  If set, a "ping" is sent to the extension
    script sandbox every 60 seconds.  This seems to be required to avoid
    an infrequently-encountered Windows bug.  (See code for notes and
    stackoverflow.com links.)</li>
  <li>Source Generation Tests.  Opens the regression test harness.  See
    the README.md in the SGTestData directory for more information.  If
    the regression tests weren't included in the SourceGen distribution,
    this will have nothing to do.</li>
