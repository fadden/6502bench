<h1>6502bench SourceGen: Code Generation &amp; Assembly</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Back to index</a></p>

<p>SourceGen can generate an assembly source file that, when fed into
the target assembler, will recreate the original data file exactly.
Every assembler is different, so support must be added to SourceGen
for each.</p>
<p>The generation / assembly dialog can be opened with File &gt; Assemble.</p>


<h2><a name="supported">Supported Assemblers</a></h2>

<p>SourceGen currently supports the following cross-assemblers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tass64/">64tass</a> v1.53.1515 or later</li>
  <li><a href="https://cc65.github.io/">cc65</a> v2.17 or later</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/products/crossdevtools/merlin/">Merlin 32</a> v1.0.0 or later</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="version">Version-Specific Code Generation</a></h3>

<p>Code generation must be tailored to the specific version of the
assembler.  This is most easily understood with an example.</p>
<p>If you write <code>MVN $01,$02</code>, the assembler is expected to output
<code>54 02 01</code>, with the arguments reversed.  cc65 v2.17 doesn't
do that; this is a bug that was fixed in a later version.  So if you're
generating code for v2.17, you want to create source code with the
arguments the wrong way around.</p>
<p>Having version-dependent source code is a bad idea, so SourceGen
just outputs raw hex bytes for MVN/MVP instructions.  This yields the
correct code for all versions of the assembler, but is ugly and
annoying.  So we want to output actual MVN/MVP instructions when producing
code for newer versions of the assembler.</p>
<p>When you configure a cross-assembler, SourceGen executes it and
extracts the version information from the command-line output stream.
This is used by the generator to ensure that the output will compile.
If no assembler is configured, SourceGen will produce code optimized
for the latest version of the assembler.</p>

<h2><a name="generate">Generating Source Code</a></h2>

<p>Cross assemblers tend to generate additional files, either compiler
intermediaries ("file.o") or metadata ("_FileInformation.txt").  Some
generators may produce multiple source files, perhaps a link script or
symbol definition header to go with the assembly source.  To avoid
spreading files across the filesystem, SourceGen does all of its work
in the same directory where the project lives.  Before you can generate
code, you have to have given your project a name by saving it.</p>

<p>The Generate and Assemble dialog has a drop-down list near the top
that lets you pick which assembler to target.  The name of the assembler
will be shown with the detected version number.  If the assembler
executable isn't configured, "[latest version]" will be shown instead
of a version number.</p>
<p>The Settings button will take you directly to the assembler configuration
tab in the application settings dialog.</p>
<p>Hit the Generate button to generate the source code into a file on disk.
The file will use the project name, with the ".dis65" replaced by
"_&lt;assembler&gt;.S".</p>
<p>The first 64KiB of each generated file will be shown in the preview
window.  If multiple files were generated, you can use the "preview file"
drop-down to select between them.  Line numbers are
prepended to each line to make it easier to track down errors.</p>



<h3><a name="localizer">Label Localizer</a></h3>
<p>The label localizer is an optional feature that automatically converts
some labels to an assembler-specific less-than-global label format.  Local
labels may be reusable (e.g. using "]LOOP" for multiple consecutive
loops is easier to understand than giving each one a unique label) or
reduce the size of a generated link table.  There are usually restrictions
on local labels, e.g. references to them may not be allowed to cross a
global label definition, which the localizer factors in automatically.</p>
<p>The localizer is somewhat experimental at this time, and can be
disabled from the
<a href="settings.html#app-settings">application settings</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="assemble">Cross-Assembling Generated Code</a></h2>

<p>After generating sources, if you have a cross-assembler executable
configured, you can run it by clicking the "Run Assembler" button.  The
command-line output will be displayed, with stdout and stderr separated.
(I'd prefer them to be interleaved, but that's not what the system
provides.)</p>

<p>The output will show the assembler's exit code, which will be zero
on success (note: sometimes they lie.)  If it appeared to succeed,
SourceGen will then compare the assembler's output to the original file,
and report any differences.</p>
<p>Failures here may be due to bugs in the cross-assembler or in
SourceGen.  However, SourceGen can generally work around assembler bugs,
so any failure is an opportunity for improvement.</p>


<h2><a name="quirks">Assembler-Specific Bugs &amp; Quirks</a></h2>

<p>This is a list of bugs and quirky behavior in cross-assemblers that
SourceGen works around when generating code.</p>
<p>Every assembler seems to have a different way of dealing with expressions.
Most of them will let you group expressions with parenthesis, but that
doesn't always help.  For example, <code>PEA label >> 8 + 1</code> is
perfectly valid, but writing <code>PEA (label >> 8) + 1</code> will cause
most assemblers to assume you're trying to use an alterate form of PEA
with indirect addressing (which doesn't exist).  The code generator needs
to understand expression syntax and operator precedence to generate correct
code, but also needs to know how to handle the corner cases.</p>


<h3><a name="64tass">64tass</a></h3>

<p>Code is generated for 64tass v1.53.1515.</p>

<p>Bugs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Undocumented opcodes: <code>SHA (ZP),Y</code> ($93) is not supported;
    the assembler appears to be expecting <code>SHA ABS,X</code> instead.</li>
  <li>BRK, COP, and WDM are not allowed to have operands.</li>
</ul>

<p>Quirks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The underscore character ('_') is allowed as a character in labels,
    but when used as the first character in a label it indicates the
    label is local.  If you create labels with leading underscores that
    are not local, the labels must be altered to start with some other
    character, and made unique.</li>
  <li>Labels starting with two underscores are "reserved".  Trying to
    use them causes an error.</li>
  <li>By default, 64tass sets the first two bytes of the output file to
    the load address.  The <code>--nostart</code> flag is used to
    suppress this.</li>
  <li>By default, 64tass is case-insensitive, but SourceGen treats labels
    as case-sensitive.  The <code>--case-sensitive</code> must be passed to
    the assembler.</li>
  <li>If you set the <code>--case-sensitive</code> flag, <b>all</b> opcodes
    and operands must be lower-case.  Most of the flags used to show
    things in upper case must be disabled.</li>
  <li>For 65816, selecting the bank byte is done with the back-quote ('`')
    rather than the caret ('^').  (There's a note in the docs to the effect
    that they plan to move to carets.)</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="cc65">cc65</a></h3>

<p>Code is generated for cc65 v2.27.</p>

<p>Bugs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The arguments to MVN/MVP are reversed.</li>
  <li>PC relative branches don't wrap around at bank boundaries.</li>
  <li>BRK &lt;arg&gt; is assembled to opcode $05 rather than $00.</li>
  <li>WDM is not supported.</li>
  <li>Source file names must not have spaces in them on Windows.</li>
</ul>

<p>Quirks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Operator precedence is unusual.  Consider <code>label >> 8 - 16</code>.
    cc65 puts shift higher than subtraction, whereas languages like C
    and assemblers like 64tass do it the other way around.  So cc65
    regards the expression as <code>(label >> 8) - 16</code>, while the
    more common interpretation would be <code>label >> (8 - 16)</code>.
    (This is actually somewhat convenient, since none of the expressions
    SourceGen currently generates require parenthesis.)</li>
  <li>Undocumented opcodes: SBX ($cb) uses the mnemonic AXS.  All other
    opcodes match up with the "unintended opcodes" document.</li>
  <li>ca65 is implemented as a single-pass assembler, so label widths
    can't always be known in time.  For example, if you .ORG $0000 after
    the point where the labels are used, the assembler will already have
    generated them as absolute values.  Width disambiguation must be applied
    to instructions that aren't ambiguous to multi-pass assemblers.</li>
  <li>The assembler is geared toward generating relocatable code with
    multiple segments (it is, after all, an assembler for a C compiler).
    A linker script is expected to be provided for anything complex.  Since
    SourceGen doesn't currently generate a linker script, binaries are
    limited to 26KiB ($6800 bytes).</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="merlin32">Merlin 32</a></h3>

<p>Code is generated for Merlin 32 v1.0.</p>

<p>Bugs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PC relative branches don't wrap around at bank boundaries.</li>
  <li>For some failures, an exit code of zero is returned.</li>
  <li>Some indexed store instructions cause errors if the label isn't
    unambiguously DP (e.g. `STX $00,X` vs. `STX $0000,X`).</li>
</ul>

<p>Quirks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Operator precedence is unusual.  Expressions are generally processed
    from left to right.  The byte-selection operators have a lower
    precedence than all of the others, and so are always processed last.</li>
  <li>The byte selection operators  ('&lt;', '&gt;', '^') are actually
    word-selection operators, yielding 16-bit values when wide registers
    are enabled on the 65816.</li>
  <li>Values loaded into registers are implicitly mod 256 or 65536.  There
    is no need to explicitly mask an expression.</li>
  <li>The assembler tracks register widths when it sees SEP/REP instructions,
    but doesn't attempt to track the emulation flag.  So if you issue a REP
    while in emulation mode, the assembler will incorrectly assume long
    registers.  (Really I just want to be able to turn the width-tracking
    off, but there's no way to do that.)</li>
  <li>Non-unique local labels should cause an error, but don't.</li>
</ul>
