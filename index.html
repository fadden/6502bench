<h1>6502bench SourceGen</h1>

<p>6502bench is a code development "workbench" for the 65xx family
of processors, including the 6502, 65C02, and 65802/65816.  It currently
features one tool, the SourceGen disassembler.</p>

<p><strong>SourceGen</strong> is an industrial-strength disassembler for 6502,
65C02, and 65816 programs.  Key features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fully interactive point-and-click GUI.  Define labels, set addresses,
  add comments, and see the results immediately.  Add multi-line comments
  and have them word-wrapped automatically.</li>
  <li>The disassembly engine traces code execution, automatically finding all
  instructions reachable from a given starting point.  Changes to the
  processor status flags are tracked, allowing identification of branches
  that are always/never taken, accurate cycle count listings, and correct
  analysis of 65816 code with variable-width registers.</li>
  <li>Easy generation of assembly source code in popular formats (currently
  64tass, ACME, cc65, and Merlin 32).  Cross-assemblers can be invoked from the GUI to
  verify correctness.</li>
  <li>Symbols and constants are provided for ROM and operating system entry
  points on several popular systems.</li>
  <li>Project files are designed for sharing and collaboration.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>Additional features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analyzer:
  <ul>
    <li>Support for 6502, 65C02, and 65816, including undocumented
    opcodes.</li>
    <li>Hinting mechanism allows manual identification of code, data, and
    inline data.</li>
    <li>Editable labels are generated for every branch destination and data
    target.</li>
    <li>Automatic detection and classification of character strings and runs
    of identical bytes.</li>
    <li>Symbol files for ROM entry points, operating system constants, and
    other platform-specific data are stored in plain text files loaded at runtime.</li>
    <li>Extension scripts can be defined that automatically reformat code and
    identify inline data that follows a JSR, JSL, or BRK.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>User interface:
  <ul>
    <li>"Infinite" undo/redo of all operations.</li>
    <li>Cross-reference tables are generated for every branch and data target
    address, as well as for external platform symbols.</li>
    <li>Instruction operand formats (hex, decimal, binary, character, symbol) can
    be set for individual instructions.  References to nearby symbols are
    offset, allowing simple expressions like "addr + 1".</li>
    <li>Data areas can be formatted in various formats, including individual
    bytes, 16-bit and 24-bit words, addresses, or strings.
    Multiple character encodings are supported, including ASCII, high ASCII,
    C64 PETSCII, and C64 screen codes.</li>
    <li>Zero-page variables can be given different labels at different points
    in the program.</li>
    <li>Multi-line comments can be "boxed" for an authentic retro feel.</li>
    <li>Notes can be added that aren't included in generated output.  These
    also function as color-coded bookmarks.  Very useful for marking up a
    work in progress.</li>
    <li>Instruction summaries, including CPU cycles and flags modified, are
    shown along with a description of the opcode's function.</li>
    <li>Various aspects of the code display can be reconfigured, including
    upper/lower case, pseudo-opcode naming, and expression formats.  These
    choices are not part of the project definition, so everyone can view a
    project according to their own personal preferences.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Code generation:
  <ul>
    <li>Labels can be coaxed from global to local as allowed by the
    assembler.</li>
    <li>Symbols may be exported from one project and imported into another
    to facilitate multi-binary disassembly.</li>
    <li>Listings can be generated in HTML form for publication on the web. Many
    aspects of the output format can be configured.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Miscellaneous:
  <ul>
    <li>All data files are stored in text formats (primarily JSON).</li>
    <li>The project file includes nothing from the data file but a CRC.  This
    may allow the project to be shared without violating copyrights (subject
    to local laws).</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>SourceGen is written in C# .NET, using the (free to download) Visual
Studio Community 2017 IDE as the primary development environment.
The user interface uses the WPF API.
The full source code for the project is available on GitHub, licensed under Apache 2.0.</p>
