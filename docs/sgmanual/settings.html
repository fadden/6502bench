<h1>SourceGen: Properties &amp; Settings</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Back to index</a></p>

<h2 id="overview">Settings Overview</h2>

<p>There are two kinds of settings: application settings, and
project properties.</p>


<h2 id="app-settings">Application Settings</h2>

<p>Application settings are stored in a file called "SourceGen-settings"
in the SourceGen installation directory.  If the file is missing or
corrupted, default settings will be used.  These settings are local
to your system, and include everything from window sizes to whether or not
you prefer hexadecimal values to be shown in upper case.  None of them
affect the way the project analyzes code and data, though they may affect
the way generated assembly sources look.</p>

<p>The settings editor is divided into five tabs.  Changes don't take
effect until you hit <samp>Apply</samp> or <samp>OK</samp>.</p>


<h3 id="appset-codeview">Code View</h3>

<p>These settings change the way the code looks on screen.</p>

<p>Click the <samp>Column Visibility</samp> buttons to hide columns.  Click
them again to restore the column to a width appropriate for the current font.
A "hidden" column just has a width of zero, so with careful mouse
positioning you can show and hide columns by dragging the column headers.
The buttons may be more convenient though.</p>

<p>You can select a different font for the code list, and make it as large
or as small as you want.  Mono-space fonts like Courier or Consolas are
recommended (and will be the only ones shown).</p>

<p>You can choose to display different parts of the display in upper or
lower case, using the "all lower" and "all upper" buttons as a quick way
to set all values.  These settings are also used for generated assembly
code, unless the assembler has specific case-sensitivity requirements.  There
is no setting for labels, which are always case-sensitive.</p>

<p>The <samp>Clipboard</samp> drop-down list lets you choose the format
for text <a href="mainwin.html#clipboard">copied to the clipboard</a>.  The
<samp>Assembler Source</samp> format includes the rightmost columns (label,
opcode, operand, and comment), like assembly source code does.  The
<samp>Disassembly</samp> format adds the address and bytes on the left.  Use
the <samp>All Columns</samp> format to get all columns.</p>

<p>When <samp>show cycle counts for instructions</samp> is checked,
every instruction line will have an end-of-line comment that indicates
the number of cycles required for that instruction.  If the cycle count
can't be determined solely from a static analysis, e.g. an extra cycle
is required if <code>LDA (dp),Y</code> crosses a page boundary, a '+'
will be shown.  In some cases the variability can be factored out if the
state of certain status flags is known, e.g. 65C02 instructions that take
longer in decimal mode won't be shown as ambiguous if the analyzer can
determine that D=0 or D=1.  This checkbox enables display in the
on-screen list, but does not affect generated source code, which can
be configured independently on the <samp>Asm Config</samp> tab.</p>

<p>Check <samp>use 'dark' color scheme</samp> to change the main
disassembly list to use white text on a black background, and mute
the Note highlight colors.
(Most of the GUI uses standard Windows controls that take their colors
from the system theme, but the disassembly list uses a custom style.  You
can change the rest of the UI from the Windows display "personalization"
controls.)</p>

<p>The <samp>auto-save interval</samp> selection determines the frequency
of saves to the recovery file.  Setting it to <samp>disabled</samp> will
disable the feature entirely, and prevent recovery files from being created
(though they will still be checked for when projects are opened).</p>


<h3 id="appset-textdelim">Text Delimiters</h3>

<p>These options change the way the code list looks on screen.  They
do not affect generated code, which must use the delimiter characters
specified by the chosen assembler.</p>

<p>Character and string operands are shown surrounded by quotes, e.g.
<code>LDA #'*'</code> or <code>.STR "Hello, world!"</code>.  It's
handy to be able to tell at a glance how characters are encoded, so
SourceGen allows you to set the delimiters independently for every
supported character encoding.</p>
<p>String operands may contain a mixture of text and hexadecimal values.
For example, in ASCII data, the control characters for linefeed and
carriage return ($0a and $0d) are considered part of the string, but
don't have a printable symbol.  (Unicode defines some "control picture"
glyphs, but they don't look very good at smaller font sizes.)</p>
<p>If one of the delimiter characters appears in the string itself,
the character will be output as hex to avoid confusion.  For this
reason, it's generally wise to use delimiter characters that aren't
part of the ASCII character set, such as "curly" quotes.  The
<samp>Sample Characters</samp> box holds some characters that you can
copy and paste (with <kbd class="key">Ctrl+C</kbd> /
<kbd class="key">Ctrl+V</kbd>) into the delimiter fields.</p>
<p>For character operands, the prefix and suffix are added to the start
and end of the operand.  For string operands, the prefix is added to the
start of the first line, and suffixes aren't allowed.</p>

<p>The "quick set" pop-up can be used to set the fields for a few
common configurations.  The default set uses curly quotes with a few
prefixes and suffixes, while "straight" uses the ASCII apostrophe and
double-quote characters.  "Merlin" uses a format similar to what the
Merlin assembler expects.</p>


<h3 id="appset-displayformat">Display Format</h3>

<p>These options change the way the code list looks on screen.  They
do not affect generated code.</p>

<p>The
<a href="intro-details.html#width-disambiguation">operand width disambiguator</a>
strings are used when the width of an instruction operand is unclear.
You may specify values for all of them or none of them.</p>

<p>Different assemblers have different ways of forming expressions.
Sometimes the rules allow expressions to be written simply, other times
explicit grouping with parenthesis is required.  Select whichever style
you are most comfortable with.
(64tass and ACME use the "common"
expression style, cc65 and Merlin 32 have their own unique styles.)</p>

<p>The character used to start a full-line comment is usually
'<code>;</code>', but can be changed here.</p>

<p>Non-unique labels are identified with a prefix character, typically
'<code>@</code>' or '<code>:</code>'.  The default is '<code>@</code>',
but you can configure it to any character that isn't valid for the start
of a label.  (64tass uses '<code>_</code>' for locals,
but that's a valid label start character, and so isn't allowed here.)
The setting affects label editing as well as display.</p>

<p>If you would like your local variables to be shown with a prefix
character, you can set it in the <samp>local variable prefix</samp> box.</p>

<p>The <samp>comma-separated format for bulk data</samp> determines
whether large blocks of hex look like <code>ABC123</code> or
<code>$AB,$C1,$23</code>.  The former reduces the number of lines
required, the latter is more readable.</p>

<p>The "quick set" pop-up configures the fields on the left side of the
tab to match the conventions of the specified assembler.  Select your
preferred assembler in the combo box to set the fields.  The setting
automatically changes to "custom" when you modify a field.</p>

<p>The <samp>add spaces in Bytes column</samp> checkbox changes the format
of the hex data in the code list "bytes" column from dense
(<code>20edfd</code>) to spaced (<code>20 ed fd</code>).  This also
affects the format of clipboard copies and exports.</p>

<p>Long operands, such as strings and bulk data, are wrapped to a new
line after a certain number of characters.  Use the pop-up to configure
the value.  Larger values can make the code display more compact, but smaller
values allow you to shrink the width of the operand column in the
on-screen listing, moving the comment field closer in.</p>


<h3 id="appset-pseudoop">Pseudo-Op</h3>

<p>These options change the way the code list looks on screen.  Assembler
directives and data pseudo-opcodes will use these values.  This does
not affect generated source code, which always matches the conventions
of the target assembler.</p>

<p>Enter the string you want to use for the various data formats.  If
a field is left blank, a default value is used.</p>

<p>The "quick set" pop-up configures the fields on this tab to match
the conventions of the specified assembler.  Select your preferred assembler
in the combo box to set the fields.  The setting automatically switches to
"custom" when you edit a field.</p>



<h3 id="appset-asmconfig">Asm Config</h3>

<p>These settings configure cross-assemblers and modify assembly source
generation in various ways.</p>
<p>To configure an assembler, select it in the pop-up menu.  The fields
will initially contain assembler-specific default values.  The values
in the Assembler-Specific Configuration box may be configured
independently for each assembler.</p>
<p>The "executable" box holds the full path to the cross-assembler
executable.</p>
<ul>
  <li>64tass: <code>64tass.exe</code>
  <li>ACME: <code>acme.exe</code>
  <li>cc65: <code>bin/cl65.exe</code> -- full installation required,
    with all configuration files and libraries
  <li>Merlin 32: <code>Merlin32.exe</code>
</ul>
<p>The <samp>column widths</samp> section allows you to specify the minimum
width of the label, opcode, operand, and comment fields.  If the width
is less than 1, or isn't a valid number, 1 will be used.  These are
not hard stops: if the contents of a field are too wide, the contents
of the next column will be pushed over.  (The comment field width is
not currently being used, but may be used to fold lines in the future.)</p>

<p>The Code Generation Settings affect all assemblers.</p>

<p>When <samp>show cycle counts in comments</samp> is checked, cycle
counts are inserted into end-of-line comments.  This works the same as
the option in the <samp>Code View</samp> tab, but applies to generated
source code rather than the on-screen display.</p>

<p>If you enable <samp>identify assembler in output</samp>, a comment will be
added to the top of the generated assembly output that identifies the
target assembler and version.  It also shows the command-line options
passed to the assembler.  This can be very helpful if the source
file is sent to other people, since it may not otherwise be obvious from
the source file what the intended target assembler is, or what options
are required to process the file correctly.</p>

<p>Labels can generally be placed either on the same line as a code or data
operand, or on the line before it.  Placing them on the same line makes
the output a bit more compact, but if the label is longer than the label
column is wide, the subsequent fields can be pushed out of alignment.
The placement is configurable.  Labels can be output on their own line:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Only when required - labels will not be placed on a separate line
    unless the assembler requires them to be.</li>
  <li>When the label is wider than the field - labels will only be
    placed on a separate line when they don't fit in the label column.</li>
  <li>Whenever possible - labels are always placed on a separate line
    when they are allowed to be.  Most assemblers require that the label
    be on the same line as assignment pseudo-ops,
    e.g. "<code>FOO = $1000</code>".</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="project-properties">Project Properties</h2>

<p>Project properties are stored in the .dis65 project file.
They specify which CPU to use, which extension scripts to load, and a
variety of other things that directly impact how SourceGen processes
the project.  Because of the potential impact, all changes to
the project properties are made through the undo/redo buffer,
which means you hit "undo" to revert a property change.</p>

<p>The properties editor is divided into four tabs.  Changes aren't pushed
out to the main application until you close the dialog.  Clicking
<samp>Apply</samp> will capture the current changes, ensuring that
they're applied even if you later hit Cancel, but the changes are not
applied to the project immediately.</p>


<h3 id="projprop-general">General</h3>

<p>The choice of CPU determines the set of available instructions, as
well as cycle costs and register widths.  There are many variations
on the 6502, but from the perspective of a disassembler most can be
treated as one of these four:</p>
<ol>
  <li>MOS 6502.  The original 8-bit instruction set.</li>
  <li>WDC 65C02.  Expanded the instruction set and smoothed
    some rough edges.</li>
  <li>WDC W65C02S.  An enhanced version of the 65C02, with some
    additional instructions introduced by Rockwell (R65C02), as well
    as WDC's STP and WAI instructions.  The Rockwell additions overlap
    with 65816 instructions, so code that uses them will not work on
    16-bit CPUs.</li>
  <li>WDC W65C816S.  Expanded instruction set, 24-bit address space,
    and 16-bit registers.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hudson Soft HuC6280 and Commodore CSG 4510 / 65CE02 are very
similar, but they have additional instructions and some fundamental
architectural changes.  These are not currently supported by SourceGen.</p>

<p>If <samp>enable undocumented instructions</samp> is checked, some
additional opcodes are recognized on the 6502 and 65C02.  These
instructions are not part of the chip specification, but most of them
have consistent behavior and can be used.  If the box is not checked,
the instructions are treated as invalid and cause the code analyzer to
assume that it has run into a data area.  This option has no effect on
the 65816.</p>
<p>The <samp>treat BRK as two-byte instruction</samp> checkbox determines
whether <code>BRK</code> instructions should be handled as if they have
an operand.</p>

<p>The <samp>entry flags</samp> determine the initial value for the
processor status flag register.  Code that is unreachable internally
(requiring a code start point tag) will use this value.  This is chiefly
of value for 65816 code, where the initial value of the M/X/E flags has
a significant impact on how instructions are disassembled.</p>

<p>If <samp>analyze uncategorized data</samp> is checked, SourceGen
will attempt to identify character strings and regions that are filled
with a repeated value.  If it's not checked, anything that isn't detected
as code or explicitly formatted as data will be shown as individual
byte values.</p>
<p>If <samp>seek nearby targets</samp> is checked, the analyzer will try to
use nearby labels for data loads and stores, adjusting them to fit
(e.g. <code>LDA LABEL+1</code>).  If not enabled, labels are not applied
unless they match exactly.  Note that references into the middle of an
instruction or formatted data area are always adjusted, regardless of
how this is set.  This setting has no effect on local variables, and
only enables a 1-byte backward search on project/platform symbols.</p>
<p>The <samp>use relocation data</samp> checkbox is only available if
the project was created from a relocatable source, e.g. by the OMF Converter
tool.  If checked, information from the relocation dictionary will be
used to improve automatic operand formatting.</p>
<p>If <samp>smart PLP handling</samp> is checked, the analyzer will try
to use the processor status flags from a nearby <code>PHP</code> when a
<code>PLP</code> is encountered.  If not enabled, all flags are set to
"indeterminate" following a <code>PLP</code>, except for the M/X
flags on the 65816, which are left unmodified.  (In practice this
approach doesn't seem to work all that well, so the setting is
un-checked by default.)</p>
<p>If <samp>smart PLB handling</samp> is checked, the analyzer will watch for
code patterns like <code>PLB</code> preceded by <code>PHK</code>,
and generate appropriate Data Bank Register changes.  If not enabled,
the DBR is set to the bank of the address of the start of the file,
and does not change unless explicitly set.  Only useful for 65816 code.</p>
<p>The <samp>default text encoding</samp> setting has two effects.  First, it
specifies which character encoding to use when searching for strings in
uncategorized data.  Second, if an assembler has a notion of preferred
character encoding (e.g. you can default string operands to PETSCII),
this setting will determine which encoding is preferred in generated
sources.</p>
<p>The <samp>min chars for string detection</samp> setting determines how
many printable characters (based on the default text encoding setting)
need to appear consecutively for the data analyzer to
decide it's a string.  Shorter values are prone to false-positive
identifications, longer values miss out on short strings.  You can also
set it to "none" to disable automatic string identification.</p>
<p>The <samp>auto-label style</samp> setting determines the format for
labels that are generated automatically.  By default the label will be
the letter 'L' followed by the hexadecimal address, but the label can
be annotated based on usage.  For example, addresses that are the target
of branch instructions can be labeled with the letter 'B'.</p>


<h3 id="projprop-projsym">Project Symbols</h3>
<p>You can add, edit, and delete individual symbols and constants.
See the <a href="intro-details.html#about-symbols">symbols</a> section for an
explanation of how project symbols work.</p>

<p>The <samp>Edit Symbol</samp> button opens the
<a href="editors.html#project-symbol">Edit Project Symbol</a> dialog, which
allows changing any part of a symbol definition.  You're not allowed to
create two symbols with the same label.</p>

<p>The <samp>Import</samp> button allows you to import symbols from
another project.  Only labels that have been tagged as global and
exported will be imported.  Existing symbols with identical labels will
be replaced, so it's okay to run the importer multiple times.  Labels
that aren't found will not be removed, so you can safely import from
multiple projects, but will need to manually delete any symbols that are
no longer being exported.</p>

<p>Shortcut: you can open the project properties window with the
Project Symbols tab selected by hitting F6 from the main code list.</p>


<h3 id="projprop-symfiles">Symbol Files</h3>
<p>From here, you can add and remove platform symbol files, or change
the order in which they are loaded.
See the <a href="intro-details.html#about-symbols">symbols</a> section for an
explanation of how platform symbols work, and the
<a href="advanced.html#platform-symbols">advanced topics</a> section
for a description of the file syntax.</p>

<p>Platform symbol files must live in the RuntimeData directory that comes
with SourceGen, or in the directory where the project file lives.  This
is mostly to keep things manageable when projects are distributed to
other people, but also acts as a minor security check, to prevent a
wayward project from trying to open files it shouldn't.</p>
<p>Click one of the "Add Symbol Files" buttons to include one or more
symbol files in the project.
The <samp>Add Symbol Files from Runtime</samp> button sets the directory
to the SourceGen RuntimeData directory, while
<samp>Add Symbol Files from Project</samp> starts in the project directory.
If you haven't yet saved the project, the latter button will be disabled.
The only difference between the buttons is the initial directory.</p>
<p>In the list, files loaded from the RuntimeData directory will be
prefixed with <code>RT:</code>.  Files loaded from the project directory
will be prefixed with <code>PROJ:</code>.</p>
<p>If a platform symbol file can't be found when the project is opened,
you will receive a warning.</p>


<h3 id="projprop-extscripts">Extension Scripts</h3>
<p>From here, you can add and remove extension script files.
See the <a href="advanced.html#extension-scripts">extension scripts</a>
section for details on how extension scripts work.</p>

<p>Extension script files must live in the RuntimeData directory that comes
with SourceGen, or in the directory where the project file lives.  This
is mostly to keep things manageable when projects are distributed to
other people, but also acts as a minor security check, to prevent a
wayward project from trying to open files it shouldn't.</p>
<p>Click one of the "Add Scripts" buttons to include one more scripts in
the project.  The <samp>Add Scripts from Runtime</samp> button sets
the directory to the SourceGen RuntimeData directory, while
<samp>Add Scripts from Project</samp> starts in the project directory.
If you haven't yet saved the project, the latter button will be disabled.
The only difference between the buttons is the initial directory.</p>
<p>In the list, files loaded from the RuntimeData directory will be
prefixed with <code>RT:</code>.  Files loaded from the project directory
will be prefixed with <code>PROJ:</code>.</p>
<p>If an extension script file can't be found when the project is opened,
you will receive a warning.</p>
