<h2 id="more-details">Intro, Continued</h2>

<p>This section of the manual digs a little deeper into how SourceGen works.</p>



<h2 id="about-symbols">All About Symbols</h2>

<p>A symbol has two essential parts, a label and a value.  The label is a short
ASCII string; the value may be an 8-to-24-bit address or a 32-bit numeric
constant.  Symbols can be defined in different ways, and applied in
different ways.</p>

<p>The label syntax is restricted to a format that should be compatible
with most assemblers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2-32 characters long.</li>
  <li>Starts with a letter or underscore.</li>
  <li>Comprised of ASCII letters, numbers, and the underscore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Label comparisons are case-sensitive, as is customary for programming
languages.</p>
<p>Sometimes the purpose of a subroutine or variable isn't immediately
clear, but you can take a reasonable guess.  You can document your
uncertainty by adding a question mark ('?') to the end of the label.
This isn't really part of the label, so it won't appear in the assembled
output, and you don't have to include it when searching for a symbol.</p>
<p>Some assemblers restrict the set of valid labels further.  For example,
64tass uses a leading underscore to indicate a local label, and reserves
a double leading underscore (e.g. <code>__label</code>) for its own
purposes.  In such cases, the label will be modified to comply with the
target assembler syntax.</p>

<p>Operands may use parts of symbols.  For example, if you have a label
<code>MYSTRING</code>, you can write:</p>
<pre>
MYSTRING .STR    "hello"
         LDA     #&lt;MYSTRING
         STA     $00
         LDA     #&gt;MYSTRING
         STA     $01
</pre>
<p>See <a href="#symbol-parts">Parts and Adjustments</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Symbols that represent a memory address within a project are treated
differently from those outside a project.  We refer to these as internal
and external addresses, respectively.</p>


<h3 id="connecting-operands">Connecting Operands with Labels</h3>

<p>Suppose you have the following code:</p>
<pre>
         LDA     $1234
         JSR     $2345
</pre>
<p>If we put that in a source file, it will assemble correctly.
However, if those addresses are part of the file, the code may break if
changes are made and things assemble to different addresses.  It would
be better to generate code that references labels, e.g.:</p>
<pre>
         LDA     my_data
         JSR     nifty_func
</pre>
<p>SourceGen tries to establish labels for address operands automatically.
How this works depends on whether the operand's address is inside the file or
external, and whether there are existing labels at or near the target
address.  The details are explored in the next few sections.</p>
<p>On the 65816 this process is trickier, because addresses are 24 bits
instead of 16.  For a control-transfer instruction like <code>JSR</code>,
the high 8 bits come from the Program Bank Register (K).  For a data-access
instruction like <code>LDA</code>, the high 8 bits come from the Data
Bank Register (B).  The PBR value is determined by the address in which
the code is executing, so it's easy to determine.  The DBR value can be
set arbitrarily.  Sometimes it's easy to figure out, sometimes it has
to be specified manually.</p>


<h3 id="internal-address-symbols">Internal Address Symbols</h3>

<p>Symbols that represent an address inside the file being disassembled
are referred to as <i>internal</i>.  They come in two varieties.</p>

<p><b>User labels</b> are labels added to instructions or data by the user.
The editor will try to prevent you from creating a label that has the same
name as another symbol, but if you manage to do so, the user label takes
precedence over symbols from other sources.  User labels may be tagged
as non-unique local, unique local, global, or global and exported.  Local
vs. global is important for the label localizer, while exported symbols
can be pulled directly into other projects.</p>

<p><b>Auto labels</b> are automatically generated labels placed on
instructions or data offsets that are the target of operands.  They're
formed by appending the hexadecimal address to the letter "L", with
additional characters added if some other symbol has already defined
that label.  Options can be set that change the "L" to a character or
characters based on how the label is referenced, e.g. "B" for branch targets.
Auto labels are only added where they are needed, and are removed when
no longer necessary.  Because auto labels may be renamed or vanish, the
editor will try to prevent you from referring to them explicitly when
editing operands.</p>


<h3 id="external-address-symbols">External Address Symbols</h3>

<p>Symbols that represent an address outside the file being disassembled
are referred to as <i>external</i>.  These may be ROM entry points,
data buffers, zero-page variables, or a number of other things.  Because
the memory address they appear at aren't within the bounds of the file,
we can't simply put an address label on them.  Three different mechanisms
exist for defining them.  If an instruction or data operand refers to
an address outside the file bounds, SourceGen looks for a symbol with
a matching address value.</p>

<p><b>Platform symbols</b> are defined in platform symbol files.  These
are named with a ".sym65" extension, and have a fairly straightforward
name/value syntax.  Several files for popular platforms come with SourceGen
and live in the <code>RuntimeData</code> directory.  You can also create your
own, but they have to live in the same directory as the project file.</p>

<p>Platform symbols can be addresses or constants.  Addresses are
limited to 24-bit values, and are matched automatically.  Constants may
be 32-bit values, but must be specified manually.</p>

<p>If two platform symbols have the same label, only the most recently read
one is kept.  If two platform symbols have different labels but the
same value, both symbols will be kept, but the one in the file loaded
last will take priority when doing a lookup by address.  If symbols with
the same value are defined in the same file, the one whose symbol appears
first alphabetically takes priority.</p>

<p>Platform address symbols have an optional width.  This can be used
to define multi-byte items, such as two-byte pointers or 256-byte stacks.
If no width is specified, a default value of 1 is used.  Widths are ignored
for constants.
Overlapping symbols are resolved as described earlier, with symbols loaded
later taking priority over previously-loaded symbols.  In addition,
symbols defined closer to the target address take priority, so if you put
a 4-byte symbol in the middle of a 256-byte symbol, the 4-byte symbol will
be visible because the start point is closer to the addresses it covers
than the start of the 256-byte range.</p>

<p>Platform symbols can be designated for reading, writing, or both.
Normally you'd want both, but if an address is a memory-mapped I/O
location that has different behavior for reads and writes, you'd want
to define two different symbols, and have the correct one applied
based on the access type.</p>

<p><b>Project symbols</b> behave like platform symbols, but they are
defined in the project file itself, through the Project Properties editor.
The editor will try to prevent you from creating two symbols with the same
name.  If two symbols have the same value, the one whose label comes
first alphabetically is used.</p>

<p>Project symbols always have precedence over platform symbols, allowing
you to redefine symbols within a project.  (You can "hide" a platform
symbol by creating a project symbol constant with the same name.  Use a
value like $ffffffff or $deadbeef so you'll know why it's there.)</p>

<p><b>Address region pre-labels</b> are an oddity: they're external
address symbols that also act like user labels.  These are explained
in more detail <a href="#pre-labels">later</a>.</p>

<p><b>Local variables</b> are redefinable symbols that are organized
into tables.  They're used to specify labels for zero-page addresses
and 65816 stack-relative instructions.  These are explained in more
detail in the next section.</p>


<h4 id="local-vars">How Local Variables Work</h4>

<p>Local variables are applied to instructions that have zero
page operands (<code>op ZP</code>, <code>op (ZP),Y</code>, etc.), or
65816 stack relative operands
(<code>op OFF,S</code> or <code>op (OFF,S),Y</code>).  While they must be
unique relative to other kinds of labels, they don't have to be unique
with respect to earlier variable definitions.  So you can define
<code>TMP .EQ $10</code>, and a few lines later define
<code>TMP .EQ $20</code>.  This is handy because zero-page addresses are
often used in different ways by different parts of the program.  For
example:</p>
<pre>
         LDA     ($00),Y
         INC     $02
         ... elsewhere ...
         DEC     $00
         STA     ($01),Y
</pre>
<p>If we had given <code>$00</code> the label <code>PTR</code> and
<code>$02</code> the label <code>COUNT</code> globally,
the second pair of instructions would look all wrong.  With local
variable tables you can set <code>PTR=$00 COUNT=$02</code> for the first chunk,
and <code>COUNT=$00 PTR=$01</code> for the second chunk.</p>

<p>Local variables have a value and a width.  If we create a pair of
variable definitions like this:</p>
<pre>
PTR      .eq     $00        ;2 bytes
COUNT    .eq     $02        ;1 byte
</pre>
<p>Then this:</p>
<pre>
         STA     $00
         STX     $01
         LDY     $02
</pre>
<p>Would become:</p>
<pre>
         STA     PTR
         STX     PTR+1
         LDY     COUNT
</pre>

<p>The scope of a variable definition starts at the point where it is
defined, and stops when its definition is erased.  There are three
ways for a table to erase an earlier definition:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new definition with the same name.</li>
  <li>Create a new definition that has an overlapping value.  For
    example, if you have a two-byte variable <code>PTR = $00</code>,
    and define a one-byte variable <code>COUNT = $01</code>, the
    definition for <code>PTR</code> will be cleared because its second
    byte overlaps.</li>
  <li>Tables have a "clear previous" flag that erases all previous
    definitions.  This doesn't usually cause anything to be generated in the
    assembly sources; instead, it just causes SourceGen to stop using
    those labels.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you might expect, you're not allowed to have duplicate labels or
overlapping values in an individual table.</p>
<p>If a platform/project symbol has the same value as a local variable,
the local variable is used.  If the local variable definition is cleared,
use of the platform/project symbol will resume.</p>
<p>Not all assemblers support redefinable variables.  In those cases,
the symbol names will be modified to be unique (e.g. the second definition
of <code>PTR</code> becomes <code>PTR_1</code>), and variables will have
global scope.</p>


<h3 id="unique-local-global">Unique vs. Non-Unique and Local vs. Global</h3>

<p>Most assemblers have a notion of "local" labels, which have a scope
that is book-ended by global labels.  These are handy for generic branch
target names like "loop" or "notzero" that you might want to use in
multiple places.  The exact definition of local variable scope varies
between assemblers, so labels that you want to be local might have to
be promoted to global (and probably renamed).</p>
<p>SourceGen has a similar concept with a slight twist: they're called
non-unique labels, because the goal is to be able to use the same
label in more than one place.  Whether or not they actually turn out
to be local is a decision deferred to assembly source generation time.
(You can also declare a label to be a unique local if you like; the
auto-generated labels like "L1234" do this.)</p>
<p>When you're writing code for an assembler, it has to be unambiguous,
because the assembler can't guess at what the output should be.  For a
disassembler, the output is known, so a greater degree of ambiguity is
tolerable.  Instead of throwing errors and refusing to continue, the
source generator can modify the output until it works.  For example:<p>
<pre>
@LOOP    LDX     #$02
@LOOP    DEX
         BNE     @LOOP
         DEY
         BNE     @LOOP
</pre>
<p>This would confuse an assembler.  SourceGen already knows which
<code>@LOOP</code> is being branched to, so it can just rename one of
them to <code>@LOOP1</code>.</p>
<p>One situation where non-unique labels cause difficulty is with
weak symbolic references (see next section).  For example, suppose
the above code then did this:</p>
<pre>
         LDA     #&lt;@LOOP
</pre>
<p>While it's possible to make an educated guess at which <code>@LOOP</code>
was meant, it's easy to get wrong.  In situations like this, it's best to
give the labels different names.</p>


<h3 id="weak-refs">Weak Symbolic References</h3>

<p>Symbolic references in operands are "weak references".  If the named
symbol exists, the reference is used.  If the symbol can't be found, the
operand is formatted in hex instead.  They're called "weak" because
failing to resolve the reference isn't considered an error.</p>

<p>It's important to know this when editing a project.  Consider the
following trivial chunk of code:</p>

<pre>
1000: 4c0310      JMP     $1003
1003: ea          NOP
</pre>

<p>When you load it into SourceGen, it will be formatted like this:</p>
<pre>
         .ADDRS  $1000
         JMP     L1003
L1003    NOP
</pre>

<p>The analyzer found the <code>JMP</code> operand, and created an auto
label for address $1003.  It then created a weak reference to
"<code>L1003</code>" in the <code>JMP</code> operand.</p>

<p>If you edit the <code>JMP</code> instruction's operand to use the
symbol "<code>FOO</code>", the results are probably not what you want:</p>
<pre>
         .ADDRS  $1000
         JMP     $1003
         NOP
</pre>

<p>This happened because you added a weak reference to "<code>FOO</code>"
in the operand, but the label isn't defined anywhere.  With no matching
label found, the operand was formatted as hex.  Further, because there's
no longer a numeric reference to the code at $1003, SourceGen removed
the <code>L1003</code> auto-label.</p>

<p>If you set the label "<code>FOO</code>" on the <code>NOP</code>
instruction, you'll see what you probably wanted:</p>
<pre>
         .ADDRS  $1000
         JMP     FOO
FOO      NOP
</pre>

<p>Of course, you don't actually need the explicit reference in the
<code>JMP</code> instruction.  If you edit the <code>JMP</code> operand
and set the format back to <samp>Default</samp>, removing the weak
symbolic reference, the code will still look the same.
This is because SourceGen identified the numeric reference, and
used that to find the label on the <code>NOP</code> instruction.</p>

<p>However, suppose you didn't actually want <code>FOO</code> as the
operand label.  You can create a project symbol called "<code>BAR</code>"
with the value $1003, and then edit the operand to reference <code>BAR</code>
instead.  Your code would then look like:</p>
<pre>
BAR      .EQ     $1003
         .ADDRS  $1000
         JMP     BAR
FOO      NOP
</pre>

<p>If you change the value of <code>BAR</code> in the project symbol file,
the operand will continue to refer to it, but with an adjustment.  For
example, if you changed <code>BAR</code> from $1003 to $1007,
the code would become:</p>
<pre>
BAR      .EQ     $1007
         .ADDRS  $1000
         JMP     BAR-4
FOO      NOP
</pre>

<p>If you rename a label, all references to that label are updated.  For
numeric references that happens implicitly.  For explicit operand
references, the weak references are updated individually.  (Modern IDEs
call this "refactoring".)</p>
<p>If you remove a label, all of the numeric references to it will
reference something else, probably a new auto label.  Weak references
to the symbol will break and be formatted as hex, but will not be
removed.  Similarly, removing symbols from a platform or project file
will break the reference but won't modify the operands.</p>

<h3 id="symbol-parts">Parts and Adjustments</h3>

<p>Sometimes you want to use part of a label, or adjust the value slightly.
(I use "adjustment" rather than "offset" to avoid confusing it with file
offsets.) Consider the following example:</p>
<pre>
1000: a910      LDA     #$10
1002: 48        PHA
1003: a906      LDA     #$06
1005: 48        PHA
1006: 60        RTS
1007: 4c3aff    JMP     $ff3a
</pre>

<p>This pushes the address of the <code>JMP</code> instruction ($1007)
onto the stack, and jumps to it with the <code>RTS</code> instruction.
However, <code>RTS</code> requires the address of the byte <i>before</i>
the target instruction, so we actually need to push $1006.</p>

<p>The disassembler won't know that offset $1007 is code because nothing
appears to reference it.  After tagging $1007 as a code start point, the
project looks like this:</p>
<pre>
         LDA      #$10
         PHA
         LDA      #$06
         PHA
         RTS

         JMP      $ff3a
</pre>

<p>We set a label called "<code>NEXT</code>" on the <code>JMP</code>
instruction, and then edit the two <code>LDA</code> instructions to
reference the high and low parts, yielding:</p>
<pre>
         .ADDRS  $1000
         LDA     #&gt;NEXT
         PHA
         LDA     #&lt;NEXT-1
         PHA
         RTS

NEXT     JMP     $ff3a
</pre>

<p>SourceGen will adjust label values by whatever amount is required to
generate the original value.  If the adjustment seems wrong, make sure
you're selecting the right part of the symbol.</p>

<p>Different assemblers use different syntaxes to form expressions.  This
is particularly noticeable in 65816 code.  You can choose which syntax
to use on-screen from the application settings.</p>


<h3 id="nearby-targets">Automatic Use of Nearby Targets</h3>

<p>Sometimes you want to use a symbol that doesn't match up with the
operand.  SourceGen tries to anticipate situations where that might be
the case, and apply adjustments for you.</p>

<p>Suppose you have the following:</p>
<pre>
         .ADDRS  $1000
         LDA     #$00
         STA     L1010
         LDA     #$20
         STA     L1011
         LDA     #$e1
         STA     L1012
         RTS

L1010    .DD1    $00
L1011    .DD1    $00
L1012    .DD1    $00
</pre>

<p>Showing stores to three different labeled addresses is fine, but
the code is actually setting up a single 24-bit address.  For clarity,
you'd like the output to reflect the fact that it's a single, multi-byte
variable.  So, if you set a label at $1010, SourceGen removes the
nearby auto labels, and sets the numeric references to use your label:</p>

<pre>
         .ADDRS  $1000
         LDA     #$00
         STA     DATA
         LDA     #$20
         STA     DATA+1
         LDA     #$e1
         STA     DATA+2
         RTS

DATA     .DD1    $00
         .DD1    $00
         .DD1    $00
</pre>

<p>If you decide that you really wanted each store to have its own
label, you can set labels on the other two addresses.  SourceGen won't
search for alternate labels if the numeric reference target has a
user-defined label.</p>

<p>This is also used for self-modifying code.  For example:</p>
<pre>
1000: a9ff      LDA     #$ff
1002: 8d0610    STA     $1006
1005: 4900      EOR     #$00
</pre>

<p>The above changes the <code>EOR #$00</code> instruction to
<code>EOR #$ff</code>.  The operand target is $1006, but we can't
put a label there because it's in the middle of the instruction.  So
SourceGen puts a label at $1005 and adjusts it:</p>
<pre>
         LDA     #$ff
         STA     L1005+1
L1005    EOR     #$00
</pre>

<p>If you really don't like the way this works, you can disable the
search for nearby targets entirely from the
<a href="settings.html#project-properties">project properties</a>.
Self-modifying code will always be adjusted because of the limitation
on mid-instruction labels.</p>


<h2 id="width-disambiguation">Width Disambiguation</h2>

<p>It's possible to interpret certain instructions in multiple ways.
For example, "<code>LDA $0000</code>" might be an absolute load from a 16-bit
address, or it might be a zero-page load from an 8-bit address.
Humans can infer from the fact that it was written with a 4-digit address
that it's meant to be absolute, but assemblers often treat operands
purely as numbers, and would just see "LDA 0".  Common practice is to
use the shortest instruction possible.</p>
<p>Every assembler seems to address the problem in a slightly different
way.  Some use opcode suffixes, others use operand prefixes, some
allow both.  You can configure how they appear in the
<a href="settings.html#app-settings">application settings</a>.</p>
<p>SourceGen will only add width disambiguators to opcodes or operands when
they are needed, with one exception: the opcode suffix for long
(24-bit address) operations is always applied.  This is done because some
assemblers require it, insisting on "<code>LDAL</code>" rather than
"<code>LDA</code>" for an absolute long load, and because it can
make 65816 code easier to read.</p>



<h2 id="address-regions">Address Regions</h2>

<p>Simple programs are loaded at a particular address and executed there.
The source code starts with a directive that tells the assembler what the
initial address is, and the code and data statements that follow are
placed appropriately.  More complicated programs might relocate parts
of themselves to other parts of memory, or be comprised of multiple
"overlay" segments that, through disk I/O or bank-switching, all execute
at the same address.</p>

<p>Consider the code in the first tutorial.  It loads at $1000, copies
part of itself to $2000, and transfers execution there:</p>

<pre>
                                   .ADDRS $1000
1000: a0 71                        LDY    #$71
1002: b9 17 10     L1002           LDA    SRC,y
1005: 99 00 20                     STA    MAIN,y
1008: 88                           DEY
1009: 30 09                        BMI    L1014
100b: 10 f5                        BPL    L1002

100d: 00                           .DD1   $00
100e: 68 65 6c 6c+                 .STR   "hello!"

1014: 4c 00 20     L1014           JMP    MAIN

1017:              SRC
                                   .ADDRS $2000
2000: ad 00 30     MAIN            LDA    $3000
[...]
</pre>

<p>The arrangement of this code can be viewed in a couple of ways.  One
way is to see it linearly: the code starts at $1000, continues to $1017,
then restarts at $2000:</p>
<pre>
+000000  +- start
         |  $1000 - $1016  length=23 ($0017)
+000016  +- end (floating)

+000017  +- start 'MAIN'
         |  $2000 - $2070  length=113 ($0071)
+000087  +- end (floating)
</pre>

<p>The other way to picture it is hierarchical: the file loads
fully at $1000, and has a "child" region at offset +000017 in which the
address changes to $2000:</p>
<pre>
+000000  +- start
         |  $1000 - $1016  length=23 ($0017)
+000017  | +- start 'MAIN'  pre='SRC'
         | |  $2000 - $2070  length=113 ($0071)
+000087  | +- end
+000087  +- end
</pre>

<p>The latter is closer to what many assemblers expect, with a "physical"
PC that starts where the file is loaded, and a "logical" or "pseudo" PC
that determines how the code is generated.  SourceGen supports both
approaches.  The only thing that would change in this example is that
the nested approach allows the "SRC" label to exist.  (More on this
later, on the section on <a href="#pre-labels">pre-labels</a>.)</p>

<p>The real value of a hierarchical arrangement becomes apparent when
the area copied out of the file is only a small part of it.  For
example, suppose something like:</p>

<pre>
        .ADDRS  $1000
        LDA     SUB_SRC,Y
        STA     SUB_DST,Y
        JMP     CONT

SUB_SRC
        .ADDRS  $2000
SUB_DST LDY     #$00
        [...]
        RTS
        .ADREND

CONT    LDA     #$12
        JSR     SUB_DST
</pre>
<p>In this case, a small routine is copied out of the middle of the
code that lives at $1000.  We want the code at <code>CONT</code>
to pick up where things left off.  If <code>SUB_SRC</code> is at $1009,
and is 23 bytes long, then <code>CONT</code> should be $1020.  We
could output <code>.ADDRS $1020</code> directly before <code>CONT</code>,
but it's inconvenient to work with the generated
code if we want to modify the subroutine (changing its length)
and re-assemble it.</p>


<h3 id="fixed-float">Fixed vs. Floating</h3>

<p>Sometimes when disassembling code you know exactly where an address
region starts and ends.  Other times you know where it starts, but won't
know where it stops until you've had a chance to look at the updated
disassembly.  In the former case you create a region with a "fixed" end
point, in the latter you create one with a "floating" end point.</p>
<p>Address regions with fixed end points always stop in the same place.
Regions with floating end points stop at the next address region boundary,
which means they can change size as regions are added or removed.
The end will be placed for either the start of a new region (a "sibling"),
or the end of an encapsulating region (the "parent").</p>

<p>Regions that overlap must have a parent/child relationship.  Whichever
one starts last or ends first is the child.  A strict ordering is necessary
because a given file offset can only have one address, and if we don't
know which region is the child we can't know which address to assign.
Regions cannot straddle the start or end of another region, and cannot
exactly overlap (have the same start and length) as another region.
One consequence of these rules is that "floating" regions cannot share
a start offset with another region, because their end point would be
adjusted to match the end of the other region.</p>

<p>The arrangement of regions is particularly important when attempting
to resolve an address operand (such as a <code>JSR</code>) to a location
within the file.  The process is straightforward if the address only
appears once, but when overlays cause multiple parts of the file to have
the same address, the operand target may be in different places depending
on where the call is being made from.
The algorithm for resolving addresses is described in the
<a href="advanced.html#overlap">advanced topics</a> section.</p>


<h3 id="region-isolation">Isolation</h3>

<p>Code in regions that have been relocated will usually be able to
access code and data in other regions.  However, sometimes code is
destined to be executed in an independent address space, such as a
disk drive controller, or is part of a bank-switched ROM that puts
multiple regions at the same address.  In such cases, you wouldn't
want the address operand of, say, a <code>JSR</code> to resolve to
a symbol in a different region.</p>

<p>The address resolution behavior for a given region can be modified
with the "disallow inbound address resolution" and
"disallow outbound address resolution" checkboxes.  The former
prevents other regions from searching for matches in the current
region, and the latter prevents the current region from searching
other regions.  (The algorithm is described in the
<a href="advanced.html#overlap">advanced topics</a> section.)</p>

<p>In some rare cases it may be useful to allow resolution to work
in one direction.  For example, suppose ROM bank #1 has a table of
<code>JMP</code> instructions for bank #2 that it will copy out to
RAM.  The table should be placed into its own address region, with
outbound resolution disabled, because we don't want it to try to
jump to locations in our bank #1 code.  It's useful to leave inbound
resolution enabled so that we can reference the table from the code
that copies it to RAM.</p>


<h3 id="non-addr">Non-Addressable Areas</h3>

<p>Some files have contents that aren't actually loaded into memory
addressable by the 6502.  One example is a file header, such as a load
address extracted by the system when reading the program into memory, or
something intended to be read by an emulator.  Another example is the
CHR graphic data on the NES, which is loaded into an area inaccessible
to the CPU.</p>

<p>The generated source file must recreate the original binary exactly,
but we don't really want to assign an address to non-addressable data,
because it should never be resolved as the target of a <code>JSR</code>
or <code>LDA</code>.  To handle this case, you can set a region's address
to "<kbd>NA</kbd>".  The assembler needs to have <i>some</i> notion of
address, so the start address will be treated as zero.</p>

<p>Non-addressable regions cannot include executable code.  You may put
labels on data items, but attempting to reference them will cause a
warning and will likely generate code that doesn't assemble.</p>

<p>It's possible to delete all address regions from a project, or edit
them so that there are "holes" not covered by a region.
To handle this, all projects are effectively covered by a non-addressable
region that spans the entire file.  Any part of the file that isn't
explicitly covered by a user-specified region will be provided an
auto-generated non-addressable region.  Such regions don't actually exist,
so attempting to edit one will actually cause a new region to be created.</p>


<h3 id="pre-labels">Pre-Labels</h3>

<p>The need for pre-labels was illustrated in the earlier example, where
code in Tutorial1 was copied from $1017 to $2000.  The fundamental issue
is that offset +000017 has <i>two</i> addresses: $1017 and $2000.  The
assembler can only generate code for one.  Pre-labels allow you to do
the same thing you'd do in the source code, which is to add a label
immediately before the address is changed.</p>

<p>Pre-labels are "external" symbols, similar to project symbols,
because they refer to an address that is outside the file bounds.
They're always treated as having global scope.
However, they also behave like user labels, because they're generated
as part of the instruction stream and interfere with local label
references that cross them.</p>

<p>The address of a pre-label is determined by the parent region.
Suppose you have a file with an arrangement like:</p>
<pre>
  region1 start
   ...
    region2 start
     ...
    region2 end
  region1 end
</pre>

<p>You can put a pre-label on <code>region2</code>, which will be the
address of the byte in <code>region1</code> right before the address
changed.  You can't put a pre-label on <code>region1</code>, because
before <code>region1</code> there was no address.  Similarly:</p>
<pre>
  region1 start
   ...
  region1 end
  region2 start
   ...
  region2 end
</pre>

<p>You can't put a pre-label on <code>region2</code> because its parent
is non-addressable.  <code>region1</code>'s address doesn't apply,
because <code>region1</code> ended before the label would be issued.</p>


<h3 id="relative-addr">Relative Addressing</h3>

<p>It is occasionally useful to output an address region start directive
that uses relative addressing instead of absolute addressing.  For
example, given:</p>
<pre>
        .ADDRS  $1000
        [...]
        .ADDRS  $2000
</pre>
<p>We could instead generate:</p>
<pre>
        .ADDRS  $1000
        [...]
        .ADDRS  *+$0fe9
</pre>

<p>This has no effect on the definition of the region.  It only affects
how the start directive is generated in the assembly source file.</p>

<p>The value is an offset from the current assembler program counter.
If the new region is the child of a non-addressable region, a relative
offset cannot be used.</p>



<h2 id="atags">Directing the Code Analyzer</h2>

<p>Sometimes SourceGen can't automatically find the start or end of an
instruction stream, or gets confused by inline data.  These situations
can be resolved by adding analyzer tags.</p>

<p><b>Code start point</b> tags tell the analyzer to add the offset
to the list of instruction start points.  Suppose you've got a code
library that begins with jump vectors, like this:</p>
<pre>
1000: 4c0910    JMP     $1009
1003: 4cef10    JMP     $10ef
1006: 4c3012    JMP     $1230
1009: 18        CLC
</pre>

<p>When opened with SourceGen, it will look like this:</p>
<pre>
         .ADDRS  $1000
         JMP     L1009

         .DD1    $4c
         .DD1    $ef
         .DD1    $10
         .DD1    $4c
         .DD1    $30
         .DD1    $12
L1009    CLC
</pre>

<p>SourceGen doesn't see any code that jumps to $1003 or $1006, so it
assumes those are data.  Further, the functions at those addresses may
also be considered data unless some bit of code reachable from
<code>L1009</code> calls into them.  If you tag $1003 and $1006 as code
start points, you'll get better results:</p>
<pre>
         .ADDRS  $1000
         JMP     L1009
         JMP     L10ef
         JMP     L1230
L1009    CLC
</pre>

<p>Be careful that you only tag the instruction opcode byte.  If
you tagged each and every byte from $1003 to $1008, you would
end up with a mess:</p>
<pre>
         .ADDRS  $1000
         JMP     L1009
         JMP &#x25bc;   L10ef
         BPL &#x25bc;   L1053
         JMP &#x25bc;   L1230
         BMI     L101b
L1009    CLC
</pre>

<p>The exact set of instructions shown depends on your CPU configuration.
The problem is that the bytes in the middle of the instruction have
been tagged as start points, so SourceGen is treating them as
embedded instructions.  $EF and $12 aren't valid 6502 opcodes, so
they're being ignored, but $10 is <code>BPL</code> and $30 is
<code>BMI</code>.
Because tagging multiple consecutive bytes is rarely useful, SourceGen
only applies code start tags to the first byte in a selected line.</p>

<p><b>Code stop point</b> tags tell the analyzer when it should stop.  For
example, suppose address $ff00 is known to always be nonzero, and the code
uses that fact to get a branch-always on the 6502:</p>
<pre>
         .ADDRS  $1000
         LDA     $ff00
         BNE     L1010
         BRK     $11
</pre>

<p>By tagging the <code>BRK</code> as a code stop point, you're telling the
analyzer that it should stop trying to execute code when it reaches
that point.
(Note that this example would actually be better solved by setting a
status flag override on the <code>BNE</code> that sets Z=0, so the code
tracer will know it's a branch-always and just do the right thing.)
As with code start points, code stop points should only be placed on the
opcode byte.  Placing a code stop point in the middle of what SourceGen
believes to be instruction will have no effect.</p>
<p>As with code start points, only the first byte in each selected line will
be tagged.</p>

<p><b>Inline data</b> tags identify bytes as being part of the
instruction stream, but not instructions.  A simple example of this
is the ProDOS 8 call interface on the Apple II, which looks like this:</p>
<pre>
         JSR     $bf00
         .DD1    $function
         .DD2    $address
         BCS     BAD
</pre>

<p>The three bytes following the <code>JSR $bf00</code> should be tagged
as inline data, so that the code analyzer skips over them and continues the
analysis at the <code>BCS</code> instruction.  You can think of these as
"code skip" tags, but they're different from stop/start points, because
every byte of inline data must be tagged.  When
applying the tag, all bytes in a selected line will be modified.</p>
<p>If code branches into a region that is tagged as inline data, the
branch will be ignored.</p>


<h3 id="scripts">Extension Scripts</h3>

<p>Extension scripts are C# source files that are compiled and
executed by SourceGen.  They can be added to a project from SourceGen's
runtime data directory, or can live in the directory next to the project
file.  They're used to generate visualizations of graphical data, and
to format inline data automatically.</p>
<p>The inline data formatting feature can significantly reduce the tedium
in certain projects.  For example, suppose the code uses a string print
routine that embeds a null-terminated string right after a JSR.  Ordinarily
you'd have to walk through the code, marking every instance by hand so
the disassembler would know where the string ends and execution resumes.
With an extension script, you can just pass in the print routine's label,
and let the script do the formatting automatically.</p>

<p>To reduce the chances of a script causing problems, all scripts are
executed in a sandbox with severely restricted access.  Notably, nothing
in the sandbox can access files, except to read files from the PluginDllCache
directory.</p>
<p>The PluginDllCache directory lives next to the SourceGen executable, and
contains all of the compiled script DLLs, as well as two pre-built
application DLLs that plugins are allowed access to.  The contents
are persistent, to avoid recompiling the scripts every time SourceGen
is launched, but may be manually deleted without harm.</p>
<p>More details can be found in the
<a href="advanced.html#extension-scripts">advanced topics</a> section.</p>


<h2 id="pseudo-ops">Data and Directive Pseudo-Opcodes</h2>

<p>The on-screen code list shows assembler directives that are similar
to what the various cross-assemblers provide.  The actual directives
generated for a given assembler may match exactly or be totally different.
The idea is to represent the concept behind the directive, then let the
code generator figure out the implementation details.</p>

<p>There are eight assembler directives that appear in the code list:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>.EQ</code> - defines a symbol's value.  These are generated
    automatically when an operand that matches a platform or project
    symbol is found.</li>
  <li><code>.VAR</code> - defines a local variable.  These are generated for
    local variable tables.</li>
  <li><code>.ADDRS</code>/<code>.ADREND</code> - specifies the start or
    end of an address region, respectively.</li>
  <li><code>.RWID</code> - specifies the width of the accumulator and
    index registers (65816 only).  Note this doesn't change the actual
    width, just tells the assembler that the width has changed.</li>
  <li><code>.DBANK</code> - specifies what value the Data Bank Register holds
    (65816 only).  Used when matching operands to labels.</li>
  <li><code>.DS</code> - identifies space set aside for variable storage.
    The storage is initialized by the program before first use, so the values
    in the binary don't actually matter.</li>
  <li><code>.JUNK</code> - indicates that the data in a range of bytes is
    irrelevant.  (When generating sources, this will become
    <code>.FILL</code> or <code>.BULK</code>
    depending on the contents of the memory region and the assembler's
    capabilities.)</li>
  <li><code>.ALIGN</code> - a special case of <code>.JUNK</code> that
    indicates the irrelevant bytes exist to force alignment to a
    memory boundary (usually a 256-byte page).  Depending on the
    memory contents, it may be possible to output this as an
    assembler-specific alignment directive.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every data item is represented by a pseudo-op.  Some of them may
represent hundreds of bytes and span multiple lines.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>.DD1</code>, <code>.DD2</code>, <code>.DD3</code>,
    <code>.DD4</code> - basic "define data" op.  A 1-4 byte
    little-endian value.</li>
  <li><code>.DBD2</code>, <code>.DBD3</code>, <code>.DBD4</code> - "define
    big-endian data".  2-4 bytes of big-endian data.
    (The 3- and 4-byte versions are not currently available in the UI,
    since they're very unusual and few assemblers support them.)</li>
  <li><code>.BULK</code> - data packed in as compact a form as the
    assembler allows.  Useful for things like chunks of graphics data.</li>
  <li><code>.FILL</code> - a series of identical bytes.  The operand
    has two parts, the byte count followed by the byte value.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, several pseudo-ops are defined for string constants:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>.STR</code> - basic character string.</li>
  <li><code>.RSTR</code> - string in reverse order.</li>
  <li><code>.ZSTR</code> - null-terminated string.</li>
  <li><code>.DSTR</code> - Dextral Character Inverted string.  The
    high bit of the last byte is flipped.</li>
  <li><code>.L1STR</code> - string prefixed with a length byte.</li>
  <li><code>.L2STR</code> - string prefixed with a length word.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can configure the pseudo-operands to look more like what your
favorite assembler uses in the
<a href="settings.html#appset-pseudoop">Pseudo-Op</a> tab in the
application settings.</p>

<p>String constants start and end with delimiter characters, typically
single or double quotes.  You can configure the delimiters differently
for each character encoding, so that it's obvious whether the text is
in ASCII or PETSCII.  See the
<a href="settings.html#appset-textdelim">Text Delimiters</a> tab in
the application settings.</p>
