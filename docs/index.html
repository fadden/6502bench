<p>6502bench is a code development "workbench" for the 65xx family
of processors, including the 6502, 65C02, and 65802/65816.  It currently
features one tool, the SourceGen disassembler.</p>

<p><strong>SourceGen</strong> is an industrial-strength disassembler for 6502,
65C02, and 65816 programs.  It runs on Windows 7 or later.</p>

<p>Demos and information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Watch a 9-minute
        <a href="https://youtu.be/dalISyBPQq8">product introduction video</a> (from v1.0).</li>
    <li>See an 8-minute
        <a href="https://youtu.be/lSvEr5nCHbY">demonstration of visualizers</a>
        in a disassembly of the Apple II game <i>Space Eggs</i>.</li>
    <li>SourceGen has been used to disassemble software for the Apple II,
        NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), Atari 2600 VCS, and coin-op arcade
        systems.  Visit 6502disassembly.com to see examples of
        <a href="https://6502disassembly.com/">completed disassembly projects</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download source code and executables for the latest version from the
<a href="https://github.com/fadden/6502bench/releases/">Releases page</a>
in the
<a href="https://github.com/fadden/6502bench/">GitHub project</a>.
</p>

<p>Key features include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fully interactive point-and-click GUI. Define labels, set addresses,
    add comments, and see the results immediately. Add multi-line comments
    and have them word-wrapped automatically. Create inline visualizations of
    embedded bitmaps and wireframe data, and define animated sequences.</li>
    <li>Sophisticated static analysis.  The disassembly engine traces code
    execution, automatically finding all instructions reachable from a given
    starting point.  Changes to the processor status flags are tracked,
    allowing identification of branches that are always/never taken,
    accurate cycle count listings, and easier analysis of 65816 code with
    variable-width registers.</li>
    <li>Easy generation of assembly source code in popular formats (currently
    64tass, ACME, cc65, and Merlin 32).  Cross-assemblers can be invoked from the GUI to
    verify correctness.</li>
    <li>Symbols and constants are provided for ROM and operating system entry
    points on several popular systems (Apple, Atari, Commodore, others).</li>
    <li>Project files are designed for sharing and collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Features in Detail:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Analyzer:
        <ul>
            <li>Support for 6502, 65C02, and 65816, including undocumented
            opcodes and the W65C02 extensions.</li>
            <li>Code tagging mechanism allows manual identification of code start/stop
            points and inline data.</li>
            <li>Editable labels are generated for every branch destination and data
            target.</li>
            <li>Automatic detection and classification of character strings and runs
            of identical bytes.</li>
            <li>Symbol files for ROM entry points, operating system constants, and
            other platform-specific data are stored in plain text files loaded at runtime.</li>
            <li>Extension scripts can be defined that automatically reformat code and
            identify inline data that follows a JSR, JSL, or BRK.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>User interface:
        <ul>
            <li>"Infinite" undo/redo of all operations.</li>
            <li>Cross-reference tables are generated for every branch and data target
            address, as well as for external platform symbols.</li>
            <li>Instruction operand formats (hex, decimal, binary, character, symbol) can
            be set for individual instructions.  References to nearby symbols are
            offset, allowing simple expressions like "addr + 1".</li>
            <li>Data areas can be formatted in various formats, including individual
            bytes, 16-bit and 24-bit words, addresses, or strings.
            Multiple character encodings are supported, including ASCII, high ASCII,
            C64 PETSCII, and C64 screen codes.</li>
            <li>Zero-page variables can be given different labels at different points
            in the program.</li>
            <li>Multi-line comments can be "boxed" for an authentic retro feel.</li>
            <li>Notes can be added that aren't included in generated output.  These
            also function as color-coded bookmarks. Very useful for marking up a
            work in progress.  Similarly, symbols can be marked as uncertain by
            adding a '?' that is automatically stripped away during code generation.</li>
            <li>Instruction reference data, such as CPU cycles and flags modified, are
            shown along with a description of the opcode's function.  Very useful when
            encountering rarely-used undocumented instructions.</li>
            <li>Various aspects of the code display can be reconfigured, including
            upper/lower case, pseudo-opcode naming, and expression formats.  These
            choices are not part of the project definition, so everyone can view a
            project according to their own personal preferences.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Code generation:
        <ul>
        <li>Labels can be global or local. Use non-unique labels like "@Loop"
        for clarity.  Labels will be promoted from local to global or renamed to
        be unique as required by each assembler.</li>
        <li>Symbols may be exported from one project and imported into another
        to facilitate multi-binary disassembly.</li>
        <li>Listings can be generated in HTML form for publication on the web. Many
        aspects of the output format can be configured.  Inline visualizations
        are exported as GIF or animated GIF.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Miscellaneous:
        <ul>
        <li>All project data is stored in text formats (primarily JSON).</li>
        <li>The project file includes nothing from the data file but a CRC.  This
        may allow the project to be shared without violating copyrights (subject
        to local laws).</li>
        <li>Handy tools: file slicer, file concatenator, CPU instruction reference
        chart, ASCII chart, file hex dump.</li>
        <li>The OMF converter tool can be used to disassemble Apple IIgs executables.</li>
        </ul></li>
</ul>
